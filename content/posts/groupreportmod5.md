This week, our group experimented with Hugo configuration and set expectations for ourselves for the rest of the semester. 

On Wednesday, we learned how to implement images and a menu into Hugo. After undertaking this activity, we realized the difficulty of modifying Hugo. While this activity didn't give us measurable progress towards the goals outlined in our group contract, it did let us experience modification of a content management system. Thankfully, Dr. Greenhalgh assured us that WordPress will be much less intensive when aiming to add simple components such as images and menus. 

Today (Friday), we discussed individual expectations and goals for the rest of ICT 302. This included our individuals goals that we aim to accomplish and what we plan to contribute to our project. We also discussed the importance of our project being a group effort and we all agreed the priority for each of us should be completing our work and contstantly and effectively communicating. As for goals for the project, we considered our "roles" but decided the ambiguity surrounding the project at the moment might make narrowing down measurable metrics difficult.
