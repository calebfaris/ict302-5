This week, our group experimented with Hugo configuration and set eexpectations for ourselves for the rest of the semester. 

On Wednesday, we learned how to implement images and a menu into Hugo. We realized the difficulty of modifying hugo after undertaking this activity. 

Today (Friday), we discussed individual expectations and goals for the rest of ICT 302.
