This week, the **I can** statement I feel I made the most progress toward is **"I can manage content using established workflows."** We spent a lot of time this week discussing what our group's workflow is going to look like and taking steps toward optimizing that workflow. This included things like discussing the type of roles each group member will have, as well as ways we are going to keep track of who is responsible for certain tasks and ensuring these things are organized in an efficient way, which brings me to the second **I can** statement I made significant progress toward over the course of this week.

The other **I can** statement I feel I took steps toward mastery in was **I can identify and employ technologies related to content management**. Something we did this week was set up a Microsoft Teams space and download the "Tasks" widget that allows us to create categories, create tasks, assign tasks to certain members, create due dates for these tasks, etc. We are utilizing a technology related to content management by using this technology that is extremely helpful when it comes to the workflow involved in content management.
