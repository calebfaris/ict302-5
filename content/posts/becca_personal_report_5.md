This week I feel like I most improved on two **I can** statements.

The first one being:

> I can describe and compare content management systems

In our final week of working solely with Hugo, we can start to compare and contrast why it is not the best content management system compared to others. For example, it doesn't have the automation in place or a handy dashboard like WordPress does. As we start to tinker with it more, we are seeing the limitation and learning curve that can come with it. While it is better than hand coding, I am interested to start messing with more accessible content management systems.

The second one being:

> I can manage content using established workflows

While we are still in the process of working on how we want to build our website. This week we made our initial personal contracts to hold ourselves to a standard in which we can expect not only from ourselves but from our group. I have discussed utilizing a tasks folder within Teams to keep up with what needs to be done, when it is in progression, and when it is completed. By doing this, I am establishing a workflow of our group and what we can expect to see every week from each member.
