## These are the step that would be necessary to get a Hugo blog post from an idea in someone's head to a published post on the website

1. Someone within the company decides a blog post needs to be
1. Come up with an idea
2. Visualize / Come up with a plan
3. Content for the post is written in a word/google doc or some other writing software
4. This content is reviewed and edited
5. Necessary changes are made
6. Steps 4 and 5 are repeated until content is satisfactory
7. Content is approved of and is ready to go onto the blog phase
5. Content is implemented into a blog format, adding pictures, titles, fonts, tags, etc.
6. Blog post is reviewed and edited
7. Necessary changes are made
1. Steps 9 and 10 are repeated until the content is satisfactory
1. Publish the post

### Roles that are involved in each step

A stakeholder or an administrator is most likely to be the one who makes the decision that a blog post needs to be made. Steps 2 and 3 would be done by someone with more of a creative role, an editor on the creative side would likely come up with the idea and a site planner would visualize the site and come up with a plan. An editor would write out the bulk of the blog post and another editor whose job is to review and approve content would look over this and give feedback and the creative editor would fix the issues within the content. Now, a developer will work with the site planner to create the actual post in the site planner's vision. This post is then sent to the editor in charge of review and approval and they will provide feedback and the developer will make these necessary changes. After this, the post is ready to publish

### Hugo Features that might be helpful in this process

Draft
* Setting draft to true can allow those involved to know that the post is not ready to be published, as well as make sure that it can not be accidentally published before it is ready.

lastmod
* Displaying when the post was last modified can help those involved in the workflow know how up-to-date the post is, so they can know if it can be left alone or should be updated

publishdate
* This makes it easier for many posts to be ready to be published, but a consistent flow of posts will be getting put on the site. This way, the whole team can easily be ahead of schedule 

These are just some of the hugo functions and how they can be helpful to a team and their workflow

### Other software that would be expected to use

Microsoft Teams
* Communication is one of the most important parts of the workflow, and an application like Teams or something similar makes this very easy

Text Editor
* This process would obviously require a text editor, for the developers to create the blog post

Github
* Much like how we use it in this class, github would be used to easily share code between users

Photoshop
* Images are important to blogs, they create a better user experience. Photoshop or some other photo editor would be necessary to make quality images for the postst
