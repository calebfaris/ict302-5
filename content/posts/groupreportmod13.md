This week our group has focused on producing the finishing touches to the overall structure and navigation of our website. We have been able to solve the little problems to our site, such as creating different categories in WooCommerce, to separate each of the different "product" types that we have.

We now have each of the designated pages that is listed in our group contract, including, a donation link, an e-commerce shop, a pet adoption finder, an events page, a services page, and an about us page. With the services and a better pet finding option being implememented this week.

We have been keeping to our lists of what needs to be done and everyone has been assigned tasks in order to help complete our site on time. We have been really focusing on how to use WordPress to our advantage and find our which features would give a user the most seamless experience if they were to visit. The main portions that are left deal with uploading content for the products in our shop and uploading pet photos and descriptions. So far everything is looking on track and we will continue to work together and communicate as we are finishing up.
