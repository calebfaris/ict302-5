During this module, we practiced integrating social links into Hugo and also worked on our Wordpress website as a group. The integration of social media links into Hugo was made easy by our theme, Ananke. I also realized how simple this was compared to some of the other configurations we have attempted in Hugo. When undergoing this process, my group and I decided to consider potential content channels that an animal shelter might use. This activity not only allowed us to gain experience with CMS technology, but also consider the marketing efforts of our hypothetical organization. Completing this tinkering activity supported the "I Can" statement:
>I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

While Friday was plagued with connection issues to our WordPress instance, my group and I did work to envision our website. By imagining the different components that will construct our website, we were able to begin investigating WordPress to see how difficult the implementation might be. We also used online resources to aid us in our operation of WordPress. My actions on Friday developed my skills relating to the "I Can" statement:
>I can find and use resources for self-directed learning

Also, after working with Hugo and Wordpress more frequently, I am beginning to distinguish more exact differences between the two, which supports the "I Can" statement below. 
>I can describe and compare content management systems
