This week we discussed content management system features and how it is difficult to give a definitive answer when deciding if a certain content management system supports certain features, due to the ability to add plugins, find workarounds, code features into the CMS, etc. This subject is very relevent to the professional world because companies have to have these types of discussions when deciding what CMS to use for any given project. During these discussions I learned about what different CMS's have certain features, thus working toward mastery in the **"I can"** statement: **I can describe and compare content management systems**
