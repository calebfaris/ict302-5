Therre were two main **I can** statements that I believe I made progress toward mastering through this weeks activities. The first one being **I can identify and employ technologies related to content management**. I went through the process of integrating social media links into Hugo and WordPress websites and the best ways to do so. The most efficient way being a group of social media icons that each link to the account the website would like to link to on that specific platform. 

The next **I can** statement I made progress toward is **I can describe and compare content management systems** Since I went through this process on Hugo and Wordpress I was able to see the differences and similarities in how this process works on either CMS. The process was actually quite simple with both. On Hugo you have to put a certain block of code into the config file and alter it to display and link to each social media. On WordPress you add a block and select "social icons", you then get a list of many social media icons and you select the ones you want, then add a link to each.
