This week I feel like I improved on the following two ***I can*** statements:

The first one being:

>I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

During this week we have started to link social media and Hugo together. In doing this we discussed what type of content and content channels we thought about creating in order to promote our animal shelter website. Even though our website is the main focus, employing the use of other mediums can help us have a larger footprint and reach.

The second one being:

>I can describe and compare content management systems

Since going back to Hugo and continuing to work on our WordPress site, I have recognized some differences between the two. Even though WordPress has more customization, it does take some work to be able to do it. In looking at themes for our sites and using ones from other groups, we realized that a lot of it was us going to be us creating the template and layout ourselves. However, at least we don't have to code everything into our website like Hugo. We also saw the problem with everyone being on the same database together and many of us couldn't connect. I know this was probably more of a bandwidth problem, but it is still a problem we never had with Hugo.
