Unfortunately, this was the first tinkering activity that rendered me unsuccessful in the end. We were instructed to examine the layout files that are associated with our active theme. While I was able to find this, I could not make any noticeable changes. We were instructed to see what changes we could make in the code that would correlate to a change on the website. 
No matter what I changed, I did not see any differing results. At the end of class, Dr. Greenhalgh walked me through a specific change so that I didn't fail entirely. While I didn't succeed, I still learned about how content aggregation was treated by Hugo. When looking at the files, it was possible to point out what each variable was putting on the front end. This tinkering activity continued to focus on the concept of seperation between presentation and content, but it also was a lesson on content aggregation. Examining what informaiton (sometimes metadata) our theme was displaying and altering that was a key point during this activity.
