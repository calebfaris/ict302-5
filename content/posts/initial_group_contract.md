This is our initial group contract, which includes a description of our plans for our hypothetical website as well as guidelines for what will qualify as "A," "B," "C," "D," and "E" work.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Our hypothetical website will mainly be used as a marketing tool for a local animal shelter that is attempting to garner public interest in the adoption of their animals. The website will also be used as a tool to connect pet owners with supplies, training, and other resources that will benefit them and their pets.

To an unknowing stranger, an ***"A"*** website should be indistingushable from a real, authentic pet-focused website. It will be complete and functional, and filled with different forms of content. It should represent our mission and be considered a **GREAT** website.

A website that should be awarded a ***"B"*** will contain everything listed above, but will lack the authentic look of a shelter website.



<<<<<<< HEAD
***"C"*** work will lack material and content, but still represent the skeletal structure of an animal shelter website. It will be navigateable but will not mimic a real website. Visitors would question the sites functionality and content.

Our hypothetical website would be worthy of a ***"D"*** if it is missing some of the main attributes listed above and does not resemble a clean looking website.



If our website managed to be absolutely terrible, bottom of the barrel work, it would be given an ***"F"***. This website would not resemble a shelter website at all and will look like a sketchy website.
