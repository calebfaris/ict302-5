This is our initial group contract
a description of what you have in mind for your hypothetical website as well as clear, specific guidelines for what kind of final project will qualify as "A," "B," "C," "D," and "E" work

Our hypothetical website will mainly be used as a marketing tool for a local animal shelter that is attemtping to garner public interest in the adoption of their animals. The website will also be used as a tool to connect pet owners with supplies, training, and other resources that will benefit them and their pets. 
Our organizations mission will be:


In our opinion, "A" work will represent a proffesional and aesthetic online appearance. It will include links to appropriate sources, attractive images, and a seamless user interface. Some specific features we wish to include are: 

-Donation link
-Shop
-Pet finder
-Events page
-Services page
-Contact page
-Mission

To an unknowing stranger, our website should be indistingushable from a real, authentic pet-focused website.
