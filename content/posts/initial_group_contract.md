This is our initial group contract, which includes a description of our plans for our hypothetical website as well as guidelines for what will qualify as "A," "B," "C," "D," and "E" work.

Our hypothetical website will mainly be used as a marketing tool for a local animal shelter that is attempting to garner public interest in the adoption of their animals. The website will also be used as a tool to connect pet owners with supplies, training, and other resources that will benefit them and their pets.

Our organizations mission will be:

> *At Project Pet, we aim to provide the highest level of care for animals by supplying the resources, education, and outreach needed to connect them with loving humans.*

In our opinion, ***"A"*** work will represent a professional and aesthetic online appearance. It will include links to appropriate sources, attractive images, and a seamless user interface. Some specific features we wish to include are: a donation link, a shop, a pet finder, an events page, a services page, a contact page, a mission page.

To an unknowing stranger, an ***"A"*** website should be indistinguishable from a real, authentic pet-focused website. It will be complete and functional, and filled with different forms of content. It should represent our mission and be considered a **GREAT** website. 



A website that should be awarded a ***"B"*** will contain everything listed above, but will lack the authentic look of a shelter website. It will contain a lot of content but would be considered **GOOD** by most people. 



***"C"*** work will lack material and content, but still represent the skeletal structure of an animal shelter website. It will be navigable but will not mimic a real website. Visitors would question the sites functionality and content. Visitors might consider this website **MEDIOCRE**.



Our hypothetical website would be worthy of a ***"D"*** if it is missing some of the main attributes listed above and does not resemble a clean looking website.It would lack a navigable structure and be missing lots of content. This website could best be described as **BELOW AVERAGE**. 



If our website managed to be absolutely terrible, bottom of the barrel work, it would be given an ***"F"***. This website would not resemble a shelter website at all and would look unprofessional. It would have little to no content and would turn potential visitors away. This website would be **TERRIBLE**.
