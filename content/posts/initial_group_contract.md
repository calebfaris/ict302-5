This is our initial group contract, which includes a description of our plans for our hypothetical website as well as guidelines for what will qualify as "A," "B," "C," "D," and "E" work.

Our hypothetical website will mainly be used as a marketing tool for a local animal shelter that is attemtping to garner public interest in the adoption of their animals. The website will also be used as a tool to connect pet owners with supplies, training, and other resources that will benefit them and their pets. 

Our organizations mission will be:

At Project Pet, we aim to provide the highest level of care for animals by supplying the resources, education, and outreach needed to connect them with loving humans. 

In our opinion, "A" work will represent a proffesional and aesthetic online appearance. It will include links to appropriate sources, attractive images, and a seamless user interface. Some specific features we wish to include are: 

> -Donation link

> -Shop

> -Pet finder

> -Events page

> -Services page

> -Contact page

> -Mission

To an unknowing stranger, an A website should be indistingushable from a real, authentic pet-focused website.
