This week I feel like I most improved on two **I can** statements.

The first one being:

> I can describe and compare content management systems

Working with Wordpress has been the first experience in working with an actual content management system. From this we can see the differences between that and Hugo. The main differences are the ease of use, built in templates, no hand coding, and the ability to customize. With Wordpress everything can be uploaded and found in a dashboard because it does a lot of the integration for you. With Hugo if you wanted a menu you would have to manually do everything versus a template upload. Even though you still have to learn how to use Wordpress, there is more room for error and less technical ability needed to achieve a good looking website.

The second one being:

>I can find and use resources for self-directed learning

Since switching from Hugo to Wordpress and having no previous experience in it, there is going to be a learning curve involved with figuring out the new system and what benefits it has to offer. Due to this, I have had to rely on other tools like Youtube, blogs, and Google to try and help navigate what can be done. For example, when playing around and trying to create a dummy post, I couldn't figure out how to get a picture to stop overlaying with a color overtop and when I tried to remove it I messed up the template positions altogether. So I looked up a tutorial on a step by step process on how to move the picture, make it into a heading, and it not have a color overlay at all.

Even when discussing what we want our page to look like, we are relying on the use of outside resources for inspiration and to build off of. We plan to download a template to use for our site, but to figure out the best one we have to do research and decide what are the important attributes we want. Since, we are using a free one, there might be features that we may have to implement ourselves to achieve our desired look, so we will have to learn from other sources how to do so.
