One of the most obvious extensions that would add the most benefit to our Hugo site is a search ability function. After creating multiple Hugo posts a week, it can be difficult finding an old post without when. When going back and looking for our initial group contract to revise, it was almost impossible to find. Having a search function, would have been something that I benefited from during this time.

Looking for other tools, at the level that we are using them at, I don't feel like many of the other ones that we examined would be that beneficial to us. However, I think a site like Hugo could benefit from the use of extensions because so much of it is dependent on the user knowing coding and being able to configure what they are looking for based on a theme. With the theme giving Hugo its main layout and structure, a few of the plug-ins made it more of a CMS like WordPress. I think this could be a good mix for someone who is wanting a static system like Hugo versus a full on CMS like Wordpress.
