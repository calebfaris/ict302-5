Today we began interacting with our group instance of WordPress. From this brief, initial interaction, we noticed major differences between Hugo and WordPress. First, creating a blog post was as simple as clicking a button. I did not have to run a command in terminal and then open the post in a text editor. In WordPress, I did not have to add MarkDown elements or HTML tags or other formatting. WordPress acts in the same manner that Microsoft Word does, in the sense that it provides a graphical UI for formatting text. 

After creating a post, I made the post public and published it with just a few clicks. In Hugo, this was done by changing a word in the file, saving, and pushing the change to GitHub. Then Netlify had merge these changes to show it publically. Also, if I just want to preview the site, I can also just click a button. 

The complex actions that we struggled with in Hugo just a week or two ago have become much easier. Adding a menu is done by clicking a few icons, and adding an image is drag and drop. I also think one of the most beneficial aspects of WordPress is the colloborative nature built into it. It seems that WordPress will be much easier to work on a website as a team when compared to Hugo. 

This activity, especially when coupled with the dummy Hugo site activity, made me truly realize the differences between WordPress and Hugo. The only aspect of Hugo that I find better is the simplicity. Although it does not offer as many options as WordPress, it is very good at its specific niche. WordPress has more functionality and also makes it easier to customize and configure, however, it did seem very daunting when looking at all of the options.
