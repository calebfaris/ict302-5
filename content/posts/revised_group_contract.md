This is our initial group contract, which includes a description of our plans for our hypothetical website as well as guidelines for what will qualify as "A," "B," "C," "D," and "F" work.

Our hypothetical website will mainly be used as a marketing tool for a local animal shelter that is attempting to garner public interest in the adoption of their animals. The website will also be used as a tool to connect pet owners with supplies, training, and other resources that will benefit them and their pets.

Our organizations mission will be:

> *At Project Pet, we aim to provide the highest level of care for animals by supplying the resources, education, and outreach needed to connect them with loving humans.*

We want our website to represent a professional and aesthetically pleasing online appearance. It will include links to our other social media content, attractive images, easy navigation, and a seamless user interface. If someone were going to be looking online for an animal shelter website, they would be able to donate, find available pets to adopt, shop for their needs, be recommended services, and be able to know of events that can be attended.

Some specific pages we wish to include in order to obtain this are:
 >  a donation link
    an e-commerce shop
    a pet adoption finder
    an events page
    a services page
    and an about us page

Our definition of content would be anything that is posted to our website. This can include articles, events posted, social media post, etc. 

To an unknowing stranger, an ***"A"*** website should be indistinguishable from a real, authentic pet-focused website. It will have every specific feature from the list above be complete and functional. It should represent our mission and be considered a **GREAT** website.


A website that should be awarded a ***"B"*** will contain everything listed above, but will lack the authentic look of a shelter website. It will contain a lot of content but not seen as professional and a ***GOOD*** website.


***"C"*** work will lack material and content, but still represent the skeletal structure of an animal shelter website. It will be navigable but will not mimic a real website. Visitors would question the sites functionality and content. Visitors might consider this website **MEDIOCRE**.


Our hypothetical website would be worthy of a ***"D"*** if it is missing some of the main attributes listed above and does not resemble a clean looking website. It would lack a navigable structure and be missing lots of content. This website could best be described as **BELOW AVERAGE**.


If our website managed to be absolutely terrible, bottom of the barrel work, it would be given an ***"F"***. This website would not resemble a shelter website at all and would look unprofessional. It would have little to no content and would turn potential visitors away. This website would be **TERRIBLE**.
