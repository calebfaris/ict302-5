In my opinion, this week focused on one major "I Can" statement that will be utilized by my group for the rest of the semester. On Wednesday, we discussed hypothetical workflows for organizations. We considered different technologies that would be used by content management professionals, and deliberated the difference in workflows depending on a number of factors (e.g. the number of employees). 

On Friday, we implemented technological resources to support our own workflow. We set up a Microsoft teams workspace and included an add-on that would support us in managing our individual tasks. All of this work supported our goals to master the "I Can" statements of:

Because we discussed and implemented these content management workflows. Also, by utilizing technology that supports these workflows, I also pursued mastery of:

>I can identify and employ technologies related to content management
