This week we leared the difference between content and presentation and how it pertains to our website we will be building

On Wednesday, we looked at CSS Garden which allows you to see how changing the CSS file effects the presentation and the content. All the content remains the same but the way that it looks is completely different. This concept is very valuable to us as we construct our website, because it will be easier to make changes to the presentation of our website if we choose to do so later on. We also changed the theme of our own Hugo website to see a similar result, as well as messing around with the files to see how different files and lines of code effect the presentation of the website.

On Friday, we discussed as a group what we would like the presentation of our website to be like and began adding content to a lot of the pages of the site. We were having some slight issues with WordPress but it was just a few small things that, as we get better at WordPress as the semester goes, will no longer be an issue. Overall, the direction we are going with our site is a good one. We know the kind of functionality we want the website to have and have included some of the menu options that we decided would be in the header, pets, supplies, events, and about. The events page and blog page have some amount of content added to them.
