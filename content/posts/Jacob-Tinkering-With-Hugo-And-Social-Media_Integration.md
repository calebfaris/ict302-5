In this week's tinkering activity, we experimented with social media integration into our Hugo site. The process to do this was actually quite easy, the assets for each social media site are already in the theme's code so all we needed to do was include the lines of code provided to us in the assignment description into the config file and modify it to the name of the social media site we were trying to implement. I was able to do this very easily. Obviously our fake business does not have any social media accounts for it to link to so I just set it up to link to each social media's homepage just to make sure it was working correctly.

We also spent some time as a group discussing what kind of social media platforms that a dog shelter should have a presence on. I believe we decided on Tik Tok, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, so these will be the sites that our WordPress site for our dog shelter will link to.
