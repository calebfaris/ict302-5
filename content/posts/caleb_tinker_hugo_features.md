For this tinkering activity, we had to consider how Hugo woulod be classified according to specific features that Dr. Greenhalgh discussed with us. After examining official Hugo sources and documentation, I have determined that: 

- Hugo is a product, not a platform. It doesn't necessarily need built like other platforms, only configured. 
- Hugo is open source and free to use, compared to the opposite, which would be propietary, commercial software.
- The Hugo technology stack is based on Go, which could be important if an organization was looking to implement Hugo. 
- Hugo is more focused on content delivery, and not entirely built to aid in content management. I think Hugo allows us to push content in a manner which makes it easy to manipulate, but I do not think Hugo on its own promotes the management of content. For example, other products or platforms are needed to manage content on Hugo, while on Wordpress all of the manipulation can be done through Wordpress. 
- Hugo is installed and owned by the user, rather than being a SaaS. 
- Hugo can be charectized as having code features, not content features. 
- Hugo supports change through code, not change through configuration. This is evident by the lack of a GUI and specific manipulative options. 
- Currently, Hugo only supports one difrection of publishing (content creator). Through the use of extensions, bidirectional publishing (content creator & consumer) can be implemented. 
- Hugo is not necessarily elegant, but it can be practical in unique situations. It allows for a lot of specific customization if the user has the right skills and knowledge.
