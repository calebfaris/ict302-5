There were two ***I can*** statements I improved on this week:

The first one being:

> I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

One of the key parts of being able to use a content management system is the goal of having a functional website that is compatiable with a wide audience. If someone can't use your website in an appealing way then there is a chance that it will be a negative experience. As you want to progress and continue to serve your customers it may be necessary to update to meet new standards. Keeping up with this standard is a concept of content management.

The second one being:

> I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

During this week we focused on the importance of addressing the shortcoming of certain systems, like a CMS. A content management system, while can do a lot for a website, it also is not a one shoe fits all type of system. There are going to be added attributes that people would like to use to enhance it's features. An plug-in is an example of technology being used to help supplement functionaility. However, it is also important to do due diligence on what you are adding to your website. Understanding that if that technology does go away there is a chance that the functionality of the website does as well. While they can be a great resource, you don't want to soley be dependent on them.
