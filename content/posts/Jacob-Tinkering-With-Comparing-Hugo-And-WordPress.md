Things we have done with Hugo over the past few weeks include:

* Making posts
* Make headers
* Change formatting of text (Bullet points, headings, quotes, bold, etc.)
* Add tags
* Change aspects of the header
* Change themes
* Add menu buttons

### Compare/Contrast

From my limited experience today with WordPress it seems like it is much easier to use than Hugo and better in many ways. Before even getting into the ways it actually makes building websites easier, WordPress makes the workflow of creating a website much easier. With Hugo, we have to use GitHub to share changes to the site with group members, while with WordPress, it is built in that anyone can make a change and it updates it for everyone else instantly. Also, with Hugo you have to go through the process of creating a local server in order to see your changes, while with Wordpress, you can see your changes as you make them, as well as preview the desktop or mobile version of the page instantly. Now as far as actually making these changes goes, WordPress is miles ahead of Hugo. I love the block system that WordPress provides. For how simple it is, WordPress gives you so much control, with dozens of things to put in the blocks. One thing that shows how much better WordPress is than Hugo is the steps you need to take to change the featured image of a post. With Hugo, you had to navigate through the theme's folders to find the featured image folder, and put your image there. But then, for some reason it made the featured image for every post that image and we would have had to alter the code of every post in order to fix it. Now, with WordPress it was as simple as navigating to "Featured Image" on the right taskbar and drag your image into it. I am glad that we worked with Hugo so I could gain an understanding of what WordPress is doing when making all these changes, but I am glad we will be working more with WordPress as the semester goes on.
