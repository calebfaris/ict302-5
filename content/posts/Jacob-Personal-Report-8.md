The main focus of class this week was the seperation between content and presentation. We did this through taking a look at CSS Garden in order to get an idea of how presentaiton and content are seperated through the use of a CSS file, and that changing it completely hanges the look of the website but the actual content within it remains the same. Along with this, we changed the theme of our own Hugo website to see how this change effected the presentation and content. Much like with CSS garden, the presentation was completely different but the content in the site was the same. All of these activities furthered my progress toward the **I can** statement: **"I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management"**
