This week our group discussed and implemented content management workflows. On Wednesday, we brainstormed the steps of an organizational workflow. We had to imagine the Hugo process and determine some possible steps from idea to publication. Some of our most important takeways included: 

- Often, the content is probably created in a non-technical format, and later transferred. We hadn't considered this because our content creation up to this point has been small posts that we worked on in-person. After thinking about this, we realized creating a Markdown file and using Github alone would probably make the process extremely tediuos. 
- Another takeaway of note was the importance of task management. 
- The final point that we thought was interesting was the possible differences in content management team sizes. After thinking about one possible workflow, we realized that depending on the number of people that the organization has, the workflow could drastically change. For example, the workflow of a single content management person would differ from that of an entire department.
