This week our group discussed and implemented content management workflows. On Wednesday, we brainstormed the steps of an organizational workflow. We had to imagine the Hugo process and determine some possible steps from idea to publication. Some of our most important takeways included: 

- Often, the content is probably created in a non-technical format, and later transferred. We hadn't considered this because our content creation up to this point has been small posts that we worked on in-person. After thinking about this, we realized creating a Markdown file and using Github alone would probably make the process extremely tediuos. 
- Another takeaway of note was the importance of task management. 
- The final point that we thought was most interesting was the possible differences in content management team sizes. After thinking about one possible workflow, we realized that depending on the number of people that the organization has, the workflow could drastically change. For example, the workflow of a single content management person would differ from that of an entire department. 

This weeks activities helped us realize the importance of implementing a workflow that is designed for ***OUR*** team. Each team could have entirely different workflows, so we shouldn't worry about trying to copy or mimic another team. Dr. Greenhalgh specifically discussed the dynamics of workflows, and how they are always changing. Our group implemented its own workflow this week, but we don't expect it to remain the same throughout the semester. 

As for progress towards goals recorded in our group contract, we didn't necessarily complete any tasks that would be found on our group contract. However, we did create our Microsoft Teams workspace that will continue to be a major communication and task management resource for our group.
