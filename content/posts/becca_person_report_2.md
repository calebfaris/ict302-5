Even though this week was a shorter one, the **I can** statement that I feel like I improved on the most was the **I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management** statement. The main focus of this week was also incorporating revenue models and what kind of content we are going to be making. As a group we decided what our mission was, who our target audience was going to be, and what key aspects do we need on our website to make our theoretical business successful. This all in combination ensures that we have a clear goal of what we want to be established within our content and helps us prioritize the expectation we have in relation to what makes good content.
