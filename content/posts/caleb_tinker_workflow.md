The workflow from idea to published post could be drastically different between two companies. In some organizations, one person could be in charge of the entire process, managing the workflow in their own head. In other companies, entire departments could be at each step. Theoretically, I imagine the workflow would look like this: 

1. Someone within the organization would decide that a blog post needed to be published (probably someone in a management position)
2. An idea would be generated, either by management or someone underneath them. 
3. A group of people would sit down to determine the appropriate length, the intended audience, and the release date of the blog post
4. A group of people could use a shared document or workspace to generate ideas about the chosen topic, i.e. brainstorming
5. Someone would assign the blog post to someone who typically creates content and provide them with the generated ideas
6. The writer would create a draft of the blog post in a Word document, and then share with their superiors 
7. The superiors would proofread the draft suggest edits, for either grammar or content
8. The writer would make necessary changes and submit to their superiors for approval. These steps would repeat until the superiors granted access.
