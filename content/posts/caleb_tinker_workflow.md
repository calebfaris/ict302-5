The workflow from idea to published post could be drastically different between two companies. In some organizations, one person could be in charge of the entire process, managing the workflow in their own head. In other companies, entire departments could be at each step. Theoretically, I imagine the workflow would look like this: 

1. Someone within the organization would decide that a blog post needed to be published (probably someone in a management position)
2. An idea would be generated, either by management or someone underneath them. 
3. A group of people would sit down to determine the appropriate length, the intended audience, and the release date of the blog post
4. A group of people could use a shared document or workspace to generate ideas about the chosen topic, i.e. brainstorming
5. Someone would assign the blog post to someone who typically creates content and provide them with the generated ideas
6. The writer would create a draft of the blog post in a Word document, and then share with their superiors 
7. The superiors would proofread the draft suggest edits, for either grammar or content
8. The writer would make necessary changes and submit to their superiors for approval. These steps would repeat until the superiors approved the post. 
9. When the blog post has been completed on paper, it would have to be transferred into code. Specifically, for a Hugo post, the blog would have to be transferred into Markdown. 
10. While in a draft state on Hugo, the post would once again have to be reviewed to ensure that all of the information is correct. 
11. Once complete, the post can then be published onto the web for users to view. 

Personally, I feel like the roles can be very ambiguous and depend on the organization. One person could generate ideas, produce and edit content, and publish the content on Hugo. In other goranizations, these roles could be divided. 

Some of the Hugo features that might benefit the publication workflow include the draft attribute, the last modified attribute, and the publish date attribute. Depedning on the size of the teams producing the content, software like Asana might be used to manage time and tasks. They also might use a cloud based document tool like OneDrive and Microsoft Word to colloboratively work on the project.
