This week our group focused on extending CMS functionality through the use of plug-ins and other developer tools. On Monday, the use of plug-ins and compatability was discussed in class. On Wednesday, we examined different developer tools that can be implemented into Hugo to extend its base functionality, such as search options, CMS interface options, and others. The content from class culminated on Friday, where we again implemnted a new plug-in into our website. 

Up to this point, we have implemented three specific plug-ins that not only expand on the basic WordPress functionality, but they also make specific actions in Wordpress much easier. We have implemented Woo Commerce, which integrates storefront functionality into our website. We have also had Dr. Greenhalgh enable Give WP so that we could easily create a donation form. We have also found a plug-in that will easily display an Instagram feed, which will help manage another content channel. 

Overall, our group has continued to progress in the creation of our project. We have made consisten progress and applied the course curriculum to our efforts. While we still have plenty of work to do, we should continue to meet our goals. Next, we will begin devloping the content on our website.
