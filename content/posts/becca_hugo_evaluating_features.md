For this tinkering activity we were able to determine what makes Hugo different:

-Hugo is not something that is meant to be a big platform, rather just a product that compliements other services.
-Hugo is open source
-Hugo cares more about delivering content, rather than content management.
-The user installs and owns Hugo
-Hugo focuses on content creation and only supports that side of publishing.
-Functional over style, it gets the job done.
