A large focus in class this week was the discussion about User Generated Content. The concept itself is quite simple, it is when users who are not actual developers of the website have the ability to create content that can be seen by other people using the website. A great example of this is YouTube. The actual company, YouTube, barely makes any content of its own. Instead, its users create and upload their content to the site for anyone else to see. This topic is a key concept in content management, and in expanding my knowledge about it I have worked toward the **I can** statement: **"I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management"**
