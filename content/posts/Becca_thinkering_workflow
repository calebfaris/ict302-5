When considering this activity these are my initial thoughts when coming up with a workflow process.

Steps:
1. Come up with an idea
2. Plan and make a draft
3. Build
4. Edit
5. Implementation
6. Test
7. Review
8. Launch

Roles:
Editor
Site planners
Developers
Administrators
stakeholders

Other software:
-GitHub
-Text editor
-FTP client
-graphics editor

Other considerations
-target audience
-objective
-site-structure
-testing
-research
-money/capital/budget
-technology needed

While this can be see as a very broad, general list of steps, the specifics could be very variant from company to company. For example, while the technology/editing team maybe the ones making the post, some might be probed by a marketing team. In other instances the company will hire a third-party to create their content for various reasons.

IN this activity the main focus was that while every company may have a different workflow, each are established by works for them as a whole.
