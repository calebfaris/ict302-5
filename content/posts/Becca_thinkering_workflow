When considering this activity these are my initial thoughts when coming up with a workflow process or how ideally I think of the process going.

Steps:
1. Come up with an idea.
Sometimes this will come from a gap in the marketing team, or in the case of a blog post just an idea that someone came up with.
2. Plan and make a draft.
This is the early stages of a post, where they are getting their thoughts and points organized in a structured way.
3. Approval.
Typically, there will be someone who is higher up that will take a look at the initial work and either approve or send it back for more edits.
4. Build.
This is where developers start to actually build the content that will be seen by humans.
5. Edit.
This is the second review stage, where the edit process continues. This is typically includes more people including the site planners, editors, developers, and administrators.
6. Implementation
Once everything is approved they will actually publish the content.
7. Test
Testing can be critical to see if the goals, audience, and missions are being met. Also, testing to make sure the site is functioning properly.
8. Review
Take the data and metrics to make sure everything is what the goals is being met of either the company or client.
9. Revisit
Continue to keep maintenance overall.

-technology needed

While this can be see as a very broad, general list of steps, the specifics could be very variant from company to company. For example, while the technology/editing team maybe the ones making the post, some might be probed by a marketing team. In other instances the company will hire a third-party to create their content for various reasons.

In this activity the main focus was that while every company may have a different workflow, each are established by works for them as a whole. The size of the company, the missions and goals, and purpose can all be factors in what kind of content someone decides to publish. I think this module is something our group will try to keep in mind as we are creating post and content for our website.
