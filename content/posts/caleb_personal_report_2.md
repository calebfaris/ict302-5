While this week was shorter than normal, I still feel like I was able to work towards mastery of our "I Can" statements at an appropriate pace.

Specifically, I developed my knowledge of content management concepts, targeting the "I Can" statement:
> I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

On Wednesday, we discussed different concepts that are associated with content management, including revenue models, the mission of content, and the intended audience of content. Understanding and implementing these concepts will be an important part of our project, and would apply to any content management career.

The work I completed with my group on Friday also helped me develop content management skills. We used effective communication to collaboratively work on the group contract while together and used GitHub to work on the document while we were separate. Using these established work flows showed that:
>I can manage content using established workflows

In this short week I still feel like I made progress towards mastering our "I Can" statements.
