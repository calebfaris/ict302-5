This week emphasized the importance of separating content and presentation when managing content. This idea becomes very important when manipulating the platform that hosts the content. We saw this idea in action when examining the CSS Zen Garden, we focused on the seperation between the content (HTML) and the presentation (CSS). We also discussed how this principle applied to Hugo, which was evident once we changed the theme on our website. I developed my knowledge of this concept, which relates to the "I Can" statement of: 
>I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

Friday allowed my group and I to continue working on our WordPress website. We began developing content for our pages and we developed the header and footer of our site. Throughout this process, we worked closely with Dr. Greenhalgh to continue learning how to customize our site. We also used online resources to learn how to operate and configure our WordPress instance. This use of online resources reinforced my goal of mastering the "I Can" statement:
>I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
