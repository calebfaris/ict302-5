Our group, Group 5, consists of Becca, Jacob, and Caleb. In this module, we completed all of the tasks needed in order to run a Hugo site both locally and publicly. We also began using GitHub to collaboratively work on our site. We began discussing ideas for our project, focusing on ideas that we thought might be unique while also being manageble on WordPress. 

On Wednesday, we began creating our first Hugo posts, and encountered some problems that were eventually resolved. Now, we have individual posts on Hugo as well as a group post. 

Overall, most things have went well regarding class curriculum and group cohesion. The only problems we have encountered have been technical difficulties, which have since been resolved. We will soon begin writing our contracts as well as narrowing down an idea for our WordPress site.
