In this module, I feel like I made good progress towards meeting the goals of our "I Can" statements. We began by defining content, which we quickly realized was difficult. On Wednesday, we also discussed the term content model and the different terms assosciated with it. I think that making us think about what content is and teaching us other terms was important for the first "I Can", being:
> I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

As a group we also deployed our first posts in Hugo, while also learning about its content model and some Hugo specific tools. Dr. Greenhalgh provided us with resources to complete these tasks, which we used to do this mostly independently. We also all had to use a web resource provided by him in order to learn some elements of Markdown. When we encountered technical difficulties, we each had to search and apply resources that would help solve our problems. These tasks all built upon the following "I Can" statement:
> I can find and use resources for self-directed learning

Most importantly, this week we interacted with Hugo by creating and publishing content for the first time. We used GitHub as a way to collaboratively work on posts while also being able to manage our indivdual posts seperately. Our interaction with these platforms apply to the "I Can" statement below: 
> I can identify and employ technologies related to content management
