During this week's activities I gained knowledge experience with the extendability of both Hugo and Wordpress. On Monday we went over what extending content management systems actually means and what good it can do for someone's website being ran on a CMS. Extensions, plug-ins, add-ons, whatever you may call them, are ways of adding functionality that the CMS does not have otherwise. In learning about how this sort of thing works and the importance of extensions, I gained experience that contributed to the my confidence in the **"I Can"** statement: **"I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management"**, because extendability is a key concept of content management

I also gained experience in the **"I Can"** statement: **"I can identify and employ technologies related to content management"** in the activities throughout the week. I did so by doing research on what different plug-ins are available for use on our WordPress site, and using some of said plug-ins myself. One of such plug-ins is woo-commerce, which we are using as a way of displaying which pets are up for adoption and how much it would cost to adopt each.
