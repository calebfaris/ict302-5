This week one of the main objectives I used was I can statement number 5. "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning". Being new to Hugo and only using GitHub a handful of times, there was a technical learning curve to using both. There were many times when I was typing in my text editor but it wasn't pushing to Hugo or I had accidentally started typing in the wrong repository I had cloned. There were two things I used to help figure out what I was doing wrong and that was talking to my group members and using the internet. Especially when I was trying to make the first post, I was getting different errors every time I tried in my terminal. By looking u the errors and reading through different forums, I was able to locate what I was doing wrong and every time do a trail and error situation until I was typing in the right thing into the right folder.
