For this project, our group's roles will be fairly flexible. Each of us will have some part in all aspects of the workflow, but we each have a specialization in a certain aspect. My main role is taking on the creative aspects.

### "A" Work

I have communicated effectively with my group throughout the process of creating our website, meaning that I respond to messages from my groupmates within a reasonable time frame and been very clear with what I am doing and what we need to do as a group. I have have ensured that the website looks very presentable and is functional.

### "B" Work

I have communicated somewhat well throughout this process. Sometimes responding late or being somewhat less clear about things pertaining to the website but all my tasks still get completed to a high standard

### "C" Work

I have communicated somewhat well throughout the process of creating our group's website and my tasks are completed, but are not at the exceptional level of "A" or "B" work

### "D" Work

I have communicated with my group very poorly, responding late very often and being very unclear with what I am saying to my groupmates but my tasks were completed, not to a very exceptional level

### "F" Work

I have communicated with my group very poorly and did not complete a number of the tasks that were assigned to me.
