This week, we began discovering the ins and outs of WordPress and how the differences between it and Hugo. In doing so, I made progress towards the **I can** statement: **I can describe and compare content management systems**. One of the main differences between the two is how much easier WordPress is to use. Instead of making changes through the code, you simply drag and drop different pieces of content wherever you want them on the page. Also, doing things like creating new posts, changing the theme, changing the featured image, and even simply navigating around the CMS are all much better with WordPress.

Another **I can** statement I made progress toward this week was **I can manage content using established workflows**. As a group, we spent a lot of time this week discussing what our workflow is going to look like and how we can make it clear to each member what their role is and what their responsibilities are.
