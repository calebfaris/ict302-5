In this week's tinkering activity we were tasked with taking a look at some CMSs other than Hugo and Wordpress and look into them. After some brief research I have found a few CMSs that seem to be quite interesting for a number of different reasons.

### Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware ###
This CMS is particularly interesting because it is specifically designed to be a CMS that stays away from the extensions/add-ons/plugins/ system that most other CMSs use. It is marketed as an "All-in-one" CMS. This allows all of its features to be very future-proof, not havingto worry about the issue of an update to the CMS causing a certain plugin to break and no longer work in that version of the CMS

### Censhare ####
Censhare is a CMS that primarily is used by large corporations to put all the digital content that that corporation might need into a single, organized space. This includes brand assets, product information, videos, and any other content that an organization might need to able to be easily accessed by different departments in the company. This is a pretty niche CMS, it really is only necessary for very large companies where this sort of data can not be very easily shared.

### CMS Made Simple ###
This is a CMS that, like the name suggests, aimed to make a CMS that was as simple as possible to be able use effectively. It strives to make things like adding themes, add-ons, dynamic menus, etc. as straight forward as possible in order to be usable by less tech-savvy people.
