While our group has discussed the flexibility of roles and the work being a group effort, we have assigned ourselves formal roles. For our group, I plan to serve as the technical lead for our content management team. Below are guidelines that I should follow in order to earn the grade that each guideline is assosciated with:

A - effective and constant communication with my team, completes all assigned tasks (within reason) at an exemplary level, completes all assigned tasks (within reason) on time, complete any technical assignments and attempt to solve any and all technical problems, attend class regularly,
	
B - good communication with my team, completes all assigned tasks (within reason) at an acceptable level and on time, complete any technical assignments and attempt to solve most technical problems, attend class regularly

C - sporadic communication with my team, completes most assigned tasks (within reason) at an acceptable level and mostly on time, complete most technical assignments and attempt to solve some technical problems, attend class often

D - barely any communication with my team, completes very little of the assigned tasks (within reason) at a poor level and is occasionally late, complete some technical assignments and attempt to solve some technical problems, miss class often

E - ghosting (no communication) my team, completes a minimal amount of the assigned tasks (within reason) at a poor level and is frequently late, complete barely any technical assignments and attempt to solve almost no technical problems, rarely attend class
	
	
	
My criteria doesn't focus on WordPress milestones as much as they focus on my contribution to my team. I believe if I continue to be a valuable member to my team and work alongside them, then we will be able to succeed.
