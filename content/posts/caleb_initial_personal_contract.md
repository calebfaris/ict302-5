While our group has discussed the flexibility of roles and the work being a group effort, we have assigned ourselves formal roles. For our group, I plan to serve as the technical lead for our content management team. 

A - effective and constant communication
	completes all assigned tasks (within reason) at an exemplary level and on time 
	
	
B - good communication
	completes all assigned tasks (within reason) at an acceptable level and on time
	

C - sporadic communication
	completes most assigned tasks (within reason) at an acceptable level and mostly on time

D - barely any communication
	completes very little of the assigned tasks (within reason) at a poor level and is occasionally late

E - ghosting (no communication)
	completes a minimal amount of the assigned tasks (within reason) at a poor level and is frequently late
