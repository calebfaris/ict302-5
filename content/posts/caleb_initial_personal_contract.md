While our group has discussed the flexibility of roles and the work being a group effort, we have assigned ourselves formal roles. For our group, I plan to serve as the technical lead for our content management team. Below are some initial, formal guidelines that I should follow in order to earn the grade that each guideline is assosciated with:

A - effective and constant communication, completes all assigned tasks (within reason) at an exemplary level and on time, complete any technical assignments and attempt to solve any and all technical problems
	
B - good communication, completes all assigned tasks (within reason) at an acceptable level and on time, complete any technical assignments and attempt to solve most technical problems

C - sporadic communication, completes most assigned tasks (within reason) at an acceptable level and mostly on time, complete most technical assignments and attempt to solve some technical problems

D - barely any communication, completes very little of the assigned tasks (within reason) at a poor level and is occasionally late, complete some technical assignments and attempt to solve some technical problems

E - ghosting (no communication), completes a minimal amount of the assigned tasks (within reason) at a poor level and is frequently late, complete barely any technical assignments and attempt to solve almost no technical problems
	
While this criteria is vague, I plan to use the experience I gain from working on the project to update this contract when possible. With some ambiguity present in the actual tasks and functions of WordPress, I have intentionally left room for improvement.
