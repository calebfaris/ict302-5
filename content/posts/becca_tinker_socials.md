In today's tinkering activity we went on our Hugo site to test the integration of social media. To our surprise it was a much easier experience than some of our past activities. The only problem that we questioned may happen is with the "follow" command. We said that it would probably be better to have two separate commands rather than Hugo combining them.

After testing it out for ourselves, we started to think about how we could use social media integration for our animal shelter website. We cited the importance it could have on getting your message out there and what platforms we would consider getting to target the audience we are looking for. We also talked about what types of content would be most beneficial on each channel. For example, posting videos and events to Facebook, tweeting to spread awareness, and posting more lighthearted, funny videos to TikTok. All of these would work to promote our website, where the main source of our content is. However, we recognize the importance of utilizing different sites to spread the same message.
