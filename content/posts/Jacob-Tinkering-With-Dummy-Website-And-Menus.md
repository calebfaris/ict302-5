In this tinkering activity I was able to play around with the inner workings of how Hugo and the steps that it takes to make certain changes to your website. From my experience there is a lot of hoops you need to jump through in order to do something very basic. The biggest example of this was when we were trying to have a different background image for the website. The only things that were changed was the new image being placed in the same folder as the old image, and the filename in the code was changed from the name of the old image to the name of the new one. This did result in the background getting changed, but it also made this image appear next to every single post for some reason, and the only way to fix it would have been to gone to each post and change the code there. 

I would imagine that Hugo is a lot simpler than just manually writing every single line of code necessary to create a website. But there are surely some better options out there than this.
