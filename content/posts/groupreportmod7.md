This week our group started to focus on integrating social media onto our WordPress and Hugo websites.

On Wednesday we started to build-in social media links and think about what types of content channels may be beneficial when building our site. We discussed what types of different content format and how much content we could output in an attempt to boost our page. We landed on linking non existent Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Youtube, and Facebook sites. In doing so, we could minimize the amount of actual time spent in content as most can be repurposed on multiple platforms, just edited differently in oder to target that certain audience.

On Friday, we started to play around with designing our WordPress site and adding in where we think social media links could go. In designing our page, we ran into some issues. While the integration of links is very easy on WordPress and the logos are already built in, coming up with an appealing look is the biggest problem. While our website is our main focus and form of content, we want to build audience over on other channels as well. In order to do this, we need to entice people into doing so in an accessible and easy way. In the upcoming weeks, we are looking to continue to build our website and keep in mind other ways we can improve our outreach.
