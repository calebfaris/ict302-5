This week I made progress towards two of the **"I can"** statements

The first **"I can"** statement I improved upon was **I can describe and compare content management systems**. Even though we have not began working on WordPress yet, we spent a considerable amount of time in class discussing some of the downfalls of hugo, like the issues my whole group was having when trying to change the background image of the site, and doing so caused a number of things to go wrong that did not make very much sense to us. Things like this will be much easier on WordPress and I have learned more about Hugo and am going to be confident in my ability to compare the two

The other **"I can"** statement I improved upon was **I can manage content using established workflows**. The way I worked toward this **"I can"** statement was creating my personal contract and setting a standard for how I should be working with my group in order to finish the website. Setting such standard and sticking to them will help me be able to manage content using established workflows
