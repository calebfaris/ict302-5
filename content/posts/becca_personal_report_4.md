This week I feel like the most improved on **I can** statement was ***I can manage content using established workflows.*** On Wednesday the tinkering activity made us think about how we thought, in an hypothetical situation, what steps might we might establish to make an idea that is in somebody's head a published piece of content that is ready for consumption. In this activity we came up with a rough idea of steps, what roles are needed, and third-party factors that might have an impact on the process of making the content.

With this in mind throughout the week we started to talk about how our own personal strengths and resources needed might impact our own specific group workflow. Caleb shared with the group two new ways of communicating, including a Microsoft Teams and a shared outlook file where we could have a centralized place of organization if we wanted. With all of this in mind we started to brainstorm how we could implement our own workflow that specifically works for our group and compared how it might be different to that of a company or even another group in the class.

I feel like I am continuing to master this **I can** statement by introducing and identifying new roles that might be needed amongst us versus the original, more vague ones that were planned (tech, admin, creative). With this new information we can continue to find gaps of knowledge and start to find any other resources needed in order to meet our accomplished goal of making our animal shelter website successful.
