Today's tinkering activity involved testing out the implementation of social media hyperlinks within Hugo. I was surprised at how simple this was, considering many other aspects of Hugo have been somewhat cumbersome. To relate this activity to our cumulative project, my group first discussed different social media platforms that an animal shelter might share content on. After that, we each began integrating different platforms onto our local instances of our Hugo repository. We also examined the differences that the "follow" attribute would create when set to true or false.

Working on this activity highlighted the integration of other content channels within a content management system. It is very common for a website to have links to its social media (or other channels). Occasionally, these platforms are used for different types of content than what is shared on the website. On the other hand, these platforms could all have the same content being pushed to them, each with its own unique presentation. I also think that this tinkering activity made my group and I consider the importance of utilizing multiple content channels.
