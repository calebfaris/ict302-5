Today's tinkering activity involved testing out the implementation of social media hyperlinks within Hugo. I was surprised at how simple this was, considering many other aspects of Hugo have been somewhat cumbersome. To relate this activity to our cumulative project, my group first discussed different social media platforms that an animal shelter might share content on. After that, we each began integrating different platforms onto our local instances of our Hugo repository.
