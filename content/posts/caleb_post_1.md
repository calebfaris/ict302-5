This is my first post in Hugo. Here, I plan to implement the use of Markdown and examine the different datatypes that Hugo supports.
- Here, I am experimenting with different headings:
    # 1. Largest heading, "#" 
    ## 2. Medium heading, "##"
    ### 3. Smaller heading, "###"
    #### 4. Continues to decrease, adding more "#" symbols
- Surrounding text with "*" will *italicize* that text 
- Changing that to "**" on each end will make the text **bold**
- > By using the ">" symbol, I have created a blockquote
- `By using a single back tick on each end of a block of text, Markdown displays the text as code, like shown here`
- Here, I am adding a link to [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/), which is a great way to waste time if you're insterested.
