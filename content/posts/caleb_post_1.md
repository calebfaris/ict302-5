This is my first post in Hugo. Here, I plan to implement the use of Markdown and examine the content model of a Hugo post. After creating the first Hugo post using: 
`hugo new posts/caleb_post_1.md`
I opened the created file and noticed that Hugo automatically set some attributes. Hugo created the title of the blog post, set the date of creation, and indicated that the post was a draft. By looking at some of Hugo's documentation, I also added an *author* attribute and added tags that can be used to classify and organize the content. 

Here, I am adding a link to [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/), which is a great way to waste time if you're insterested.
