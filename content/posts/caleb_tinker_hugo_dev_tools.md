After discussing with my group, we agreed that the most useful extension for our Hugo website would be a search ability. I personally experienced this when looking back through our old posts and realizing the mass amounts of content that our group has collectively created throughout the semester. Our website has no searching or browsing options currently, leaving chronology the only method of information organization. Due to these factors, we consider integrating a search function to be the most helpful extension for our CMS. 

After examining other tools for Hugo developers, I didn't understand the purpose of the Commercial Services offered underneath the Frontend Interfaces for Hugo. I was initially confused because the wording used described the tools as a CMS. However, after invesitgating further I realized that the interfaces turned Hugo into a CMS with a GUI. The example I inspected looked quite similar to WordPress. 

I find it interesting that other organization have extended Hugo far enough away from its default settings that it doesn't resemble Hugo at all. Overall, even though i didnt modify my Hugo site, I now realize the true potential of plug ins and their ability to modify the architecture of a CMS.
