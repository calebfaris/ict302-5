In today's activity I think our group realized the major downside of Hugo and it's limitations. While it does provide some basic formatting and themes so you don't have to manually hand code it, I don't think it is the most effective CMS out there.

One of the major problems we had was assigning pictures and folder names. We ended up looking into three different "static" folders to try and place an image with each one giving a different result. One thing that was particularly not helpful was copying and pasting the base code into the text editor and it overriding what we actually wanted it to do. Once we found the correct place to enter the code for the menus it wasn't too much of a hassle to establish that, just more tedious.

In relation to how it acts as a content management system, even though it doesn't reference a database, it can be argued that it meets the requirement. However, I don't think it is the best one.

Using the following definition:

>A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content.
  -Deane Barker

Hugo could assist someone in doing all of those roles, however, it is something that can be easy to break and a headache to fix. Also, there isn't a lot of automation when it cones to the process. If you want to add something that is not available in the theme you have to have some knowledge of code/programming in order to make those changes, versus a CMS that has something like a dashboard. There is a bigger learning curve with Hugo.
