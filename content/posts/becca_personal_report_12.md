This week I feel like I improved on the following two ***I can*** statements:

The first **I can** being:

>I can manage content using established workflows

This week I started to refocus on making sure that we had a structure for what needed to still be done as we are wrapping up the semester soon. I have created a list and assigned tasks based on what work was left and reasonable timelines so we can ensure to get an A based on our group contract. In doing this, it allowed for us as a group to establish a workflow, even on an unstructured week, to collaborate more and rely on each other for updates on tasks.

The second **I can** being:

>I can find and use resources for self-directed learning

This week while working on our WordPress site I ran into a few issues. For example one being, trying to create two seperate store categories and making sure not everything fed into one product section. In doing this, I relied mainly on Google and Youtube to try and fix this problem. Even though I wasn't able to completely solve the problem, I was able to come up with other solutions that allowed for the same desired affect.
