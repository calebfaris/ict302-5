In this tinkering activity we were learning about the relationship between content and presentation using two methods. The first was using the CSS Garden site to quickly see how changing the CSS file could result in a completely different looking website that still had all the same contentas before. This just showed us how seperating content and presentation can be very helpful from a developer's standpoint because if they wish to make a change to the presentation they would not have to go through every single file to do so, but just making a change to the CSS file.

The next thing we did was change the theme of our own hugo website to see this effect take place on our own work. The process of doing this was simple enough, it was basically downloading a new theme, putting it into the themes folder, and changing a line in the config file to the name of the new theme. This then toook our website and, like with the CSS Garden activity, changed the presentation completely yet kept all the content the same. Our website is relatively small, with a few dozen posts in total, but I can not imagine how annoying it would be if we had to change the presentation of each individual page on our site rather than doing so in one step. The seperation of content and presentation is something that is very beneficial to developers for this reason
