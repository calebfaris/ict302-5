Immediately, one of the developer tools that would be the most helpful is adding the ability to search through the Hugo site. As we have made more and more posts throughout the semester it has become increasingly difficult to find specific posts that I need to look at. The addition of tags has made this a little bit easier but being able to actually search "Personal Contract", for example, would be much easier than scrolling through, finding someone's personal contract post, clicking on the "Personal Contract" tag and scrolling though to find the post I need.

One of the features that I do not think is all that helpful is the option to give Hugo a graphical interface. I think a graphical interface in general is a very helpful feature, but it feels like if someone wanted a CMS with a graphical interface they would have just used WordPress instead of dealing with Hugo at all. I may be ignorant to some reasons that people may want to use Hugo with a graphical interface instead of just using WordPress, but it just does not seem practical.
