This week I felt as though I imporved on two ***I can*** statements.

The first one being:

>I can find and use resources for self-directed learning

As we are finishing up our websites, we are finally putting on the finishing touches. This has included going back and doing the small more annoying things that need to be done, but nobody in the group knew how to do. For example, changing the "read more" buttons to say something different. To achieve this change, I implemented YouTube and foruns online to see if anybody ekse was able to change it. In doing this I feel like I can continue to work on this I can statement. 

The second one being:

>I can describe and compare content management systems

This week our main focus is figuring our how to describe and find what our specifics needs from a CMS might be. This can vary from company to company and there a lot of different factors that may influence one's decision. We talked about the importance of creating a checklist and prioritizing needs because there is not going to be a perfect CMS out there.
