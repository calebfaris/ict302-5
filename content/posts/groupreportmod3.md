With this week being short, our group didn't have many tasks to complete compared to a typical week. However, this week did prove to be extremely productive when looking at what we accomplished. Specifically, we narrowed down our idea for our hypothetical organization/website and began drafting our group contract for the project. This group contract will eventually be used as a reference for these weekly group reports, however we have decided to take the weekend to narrow down the guidelines for our project. 

Our work this week allowed us to communicate effectively while brainstorming and forced us to be creative in our ideas for our website. With no tangible model or reference for our website, we had to use our imagination to begin envisioning what our website would/should look like. 

By Sunday, we plan to have our initial group contract submitted, which will portray a much clearer picture of our future website. In the end, this short week possessed the most collaboration that our group has experienced, and we all agree that we excelled!
