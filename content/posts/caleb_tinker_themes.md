Today's tinkering activity introduced my group and I to other the CSS Zen Garden and more Hugo themes. The CSS Zen Garden is a site that highlights the separation of content (the HTML file) and presentation (the CSS style sheet). In that example, the same content could be represented in drastically different visual ways at the click of a button. Once we moved on to examining other Hugo themes, we also saw this principal in action (albeit, a little more cumbersome to implement the changes). 

To complete the activity, I found an interesting Hugo theme and downloaded it from Github. I placed it into the themes directory that Hugo uses to visually represent the content. I then changed a line in the configuration file so that it knew which theme directory to use. Overall, this was a fairly straightforward process that allowed me to see how Hugo separates content and presentation. 

This week, we are focusing on the separation between content and presentation. Deane Barker and Dr. Greenhalgh seem to agree that it is important, so it must be! In all seriousness, this activity made this idea come to life. After Monday's lecture, I understood the idea conceptually, but did not realize the practicality. Now, I realize that separating the two is important for a number of reasons. Our activity showed that it might be separated for aesthetic reasons, but I also began thinking about global variables and functions when coding. These are kept separate so a change to them could be recognized by any object associated with them. If this structure wasn't in place, it would be difficult to seamless transition between two different themes or variables. I also think separating content and presentation makes the content management process more efficient because each sector can be modified independently.
