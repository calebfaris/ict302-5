This week we, as a group, spent a lot of time deciding the direction we are going to go with our website, these conversations included what type of establishment our website would be for, what the goal of the website would be, what sort of content would need to go on this website, etc. We decided to make a website for a local animal shelter and I decided to do some research on other animal shelter websites in order to get a better understanding of the sort of things we should have in our own website. This process helped me improve upon the **I can** statement: **I can find and use resources for self-directed learning** 

During our conversations about the things that are going to go into the thought process behind the way we design our website, such as revenue models, our mission, our target audience, etc. I was able to work toward the **I can** statement: **I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management**. I made progress towards this because we were constantly doing a "real world" example of all of these concepts, giving me a great understanding of each of them.
