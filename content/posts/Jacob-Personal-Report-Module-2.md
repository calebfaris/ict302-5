In this module I would say that I made progress toward a few different "I Can" statements that are guiding objectives for this course. When we learned about the term "Content Model", as well as what makes up a content model. These include type, attributes, and datatypes. These all contribute to my progress toward the "I Can" statement: "I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management".


During assignments such as "submit personal report for Module 2" and "tinker with Hugo content model", we were tasked with using Hugo as well as the coding language "Markdown" to make posts on our group's netlify site. Accomplishing all these tasks helped me make progress toward the "I Can" statement: "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management".
