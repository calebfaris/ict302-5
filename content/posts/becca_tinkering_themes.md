This week in doing the themes and CSS tinkering activity we tried to accomplish and think about something that is nearly impossible to do. That is the ideal of separating the content of our Hugo site from it's presentation/themes.

In doing this, we were able to see that while it is not possible it is still an important idea to practice. Typically when you are making a page when working for a company you aren't going to be the only one doing all of the work. If you are someone who is coding the post, then you are almost strictly just working on the content.However, if you are a designer, editor, etc. you probably aren't working with the actual content the most, but the presentation. Even though both separate, they work together to portray whatever message/point they are trying to make.

Also, it allows you to change one thing without changing the other. If you change some of the code in the content folder, you don't have to worry about it completely messing up the code for your presentation. With this you can even utilize different tools specifically designed for each portion to come together to make the best outcome.

One trouble that I personally had was downloading one theme. For some reason that particular theme was not wanting to display it when I tried to push it locally, but then after trying a different one, was able to display it.
