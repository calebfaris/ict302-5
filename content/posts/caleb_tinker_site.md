This tinkering activity highlighted the cumbersome efforts need to customize and/or adjust the different components of Hugo. During the activity, I managed to change the content flow of the home page by creating an `_index.md` file. I also was able to add photos to the home page and the about page. I concluded class by adding menu items at the top of the screen. 

This assignment made me realize that, while it has its purpose, Hugo isn't made to be a CMS for an animal shleter or a store. My main takeaway from this activity is that, while Hugo does handle text well, it isn't necessarily designed to be easily formatted or to handle content that isn't text. This also makes me want to dive into Wordpress to see the similarities and differences (of which I am sure there are many) between the two CMSs. I look forward to being able to deploy many types of content on WordPress without struggling to find or understand the platform.
