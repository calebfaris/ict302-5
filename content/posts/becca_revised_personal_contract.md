While within our group we have discussed that we all will contribute to the overall outcome of our final product we did assign ourselves roles within to help ensure responsibility and accountability. For me personally I am going to be seen as the "administrator" or similar to a project manager. For the following this is my initial grading criteria for the rest of my group members to grade me on.

***A*** - I will be an communicative and reliable group member that helps establish when and whether things get done. I will complete all of my assigned task on time and in high standard. I will start to incorporate the tasks folder in our Teams and update it weekly to help establish workflow once we begin working on our website.

***B***- I will have good communication and complete all of my task at a solid standard. I will still use Teams, but not update it when things are completed or a new tasks needs to be established.

***C***- I will communicate most of the time, complete most of my assigned tasks on time, and to a subpar standard. I will not update Teams Task weekly and it will be sporadically.

***D***- I will not communicate more times than I do, complete some of my assigned tasks on time, and do the bare minimum for them. I will not update tasks and hold no one to a standard.

***F***- I will not talk to anyone in my group and won't complete my tasks assigned to me. I will not attempt to do anything with anyone in my group collaboratively.
